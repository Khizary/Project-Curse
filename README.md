# Project-Curse


C.U.R.S.E -> Collction of Unified Resources for Studying Efficiently

An online self sustaining blog to provide access to the best educational resources, attested notes, and collection of materials and provide every student with an equal oppurtunity to excel academically therefore allowing them to obtain higher education more effectively.
Curently the project is hosted on free plans for both the DB and Server, but once we are in release production we will shift to better tiers of domain and hosting.
